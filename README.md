# EV Infrastructure Planning and Analysis 
## Problem Statement
As EV adoption increases across New York, there is a critical need to balance charger capacity and EV demand. Insufficient charging infrastructure may discourage EV use, while overbuilt infrastructure is costly. City planners and charging operators must identify gaps in coverage, optimize station performance, and plan for growth in a data-driven way.
## âœ… This dashboard addresses:
1.**Which ZIP codes have the highest EV-to-charger ratios?**

2.**What is the number of stations in particular city?**

3.**What is the number of registered vehicles in particular city?**

4.**What is the average age of charging stations?**

5.**What types of chargers are most common?**

6.**Where should new chargers be installed?**

7.**What is the EV registration growth rate?**

8.**Where is the EV infrastructure lacking?**

9.**What is the EV to Charger ratio?**

10.**What are the top charger network providers?**

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

 1.**EV Charging Stations Dataset**

station name, latitude/longitude, charger type, capacity, connector types, renewable energy status, installation year, reviews, maintenance frequency

2.**EV Registrations Dataset (DMV)**

ZIP code, registration date, vehicle make/model/year, drivetrain, GVWR class, vehicle counts, DMV snapshot information

3.**US cities Dataset**

city name, state id,	state name,	county name,	latitide,	longitude, id


## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

1.Power BI (data modeling, visualization)

2.Power Query (data transformation & cleaning)

3.SQL (initial data preparation)

4.Excel (quick checks & exploratory cleaning)

5.DAX (measures & KPIs)
